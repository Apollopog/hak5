The following is an example of how to hide the command window below the bottom of the screen while typing in commands. The window movement part of the script can also be used on any other window. CMD.exe is also run with some command line flags for changing the appearance of the window to make it harder to view, and also a flag that turns on delayed expansion in the command prompt which allows for variable names to be called more than once in a line with no adverse effects. Ex... SET Something = Something + Something_Else

The following is an unrefined attempt at creating a hide CMD window script that uses a key combo to run as administrator when UAC is turned on. The delays in this script are very heavy, and I will be making refinements later, so expect this script to change rapidly.
